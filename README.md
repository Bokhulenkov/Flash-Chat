## About

One of the most fundamental component of modern iOS apps is the Table View. Table Views are used everywhere from the Mail app to the Messages app. It’s a crucial part of every iOS developer’s tool belt. In this tutorial we’ll be getting to grips with Table Views, creating custom cells, and making our own cloud-based backend database. It’s going to be epic, so buckle up.

## What you will create

Flash Chat is an internet based messaging app similar to WhatsApp, the popular messaging app that was bought by Facebook for $22 billion. We will be using a service called Firebase Firestore as a backend database to store and retrieve our messages from the cloud. 

## What i do

* I'm integrate third party libraries in app using Cocoapods and Swift Package Manager.
* Store data in the cloud using Firebase Firestore.
* Sort the Firebase database.
* Use Firebase for user authentication, registration and login.
* Create custom views using .xib files to modify native design components.
